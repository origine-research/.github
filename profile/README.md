## About us
The founders of Origine who are troubled by the use of
Harsh chemical-driven products in the market. Upon
exploration, each one had a different skin type where one
cannot be matched by the millions of microbiome on their
skin surface. So, thinking of how to solve this problem
they went on a research for finding the suitable natural
formulation by going back to the roots researching
olaichuvadi, an Indian version of Papyrus, 5000yr+ old
formula on how people used remedies skincare before
the incorporation of corporate companies and chemicals.
Out of the 1000+ iterations they found a perfect
combination for each one's skin type. They found an idea
of why not we do an Origine formulation for every unique
skin type through an AI model. Our founders are like the
sandpiper bird always looking for unique solutions for
their needs.
